My twist on his tutorial is that I need to run my model on a Raspberry Pi with live video feed.  As the Raspberry Pi is fairly limited on CPU power and can only run object detection at 1-2 FPS (frames/sec), I have purchased the newly release $75 Google's [EdgeTPU USB Accelarator](https://coral.withgoogle.com/products/accelerator), which can detect objects at 12 FPS, which is sufficient for real time work.  After doing the transfer learning from one of the object detection models using our own images, last few steps of the colab deals with how to convert a trained model to a model file that can be consumed by an Edge TPU, namely, the final `mymodel_quantized_edgetpu.tflite` file.  \n","\n","\n","![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*_jABdMfUVcyPdi5b3zlfVg.jpeg)\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"etOThFKokSmU"},"source":["# Section 1: Mount Google drive\n","Mount my Google Drive and save modeling output files (`.ckpt`)  there, so that it won't be wiped out when colab Virtual Machine restarts.
